          Ancient lake in Mars’s Gale crater may have actually been a small pond
        </p>
        <p>
          A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than
          researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale
          crater for more than eight years, and while early observations
          suggested the entire crater may once have been filled with water, a
          new analysis implies that it just had a series of ponds instead.
          Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a
          measure called the chemical index of alteration to determine how rocks
          were weathered over time. Joseph Michalski at the University of Hong
          Kong and his colleagues have suggested that because this measure was
          developed for use on Earth, it may not be valid in the extreme Martian
          climate. Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various
          compounds that are expected to change based on different types of
          weathering over time. They found that some of the layers of rock
          Curiosity examined did interact with water at some point in their
          past, but more are likely to have formed outside of the water.

          “Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers that
          are demonstrably lacustrine [formed in a lake] are the lower few
          metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the
          fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per
          cent.” These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of sediments
          in the crater, suggesting the lake was not nearly as deep or extensive
          as we thought. “There was likely a small lake or more likely a series
          of small lakes in the floor of Gale crater, but these were shallow
          ponds,” says Michalski. The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared
          to be volcanic, so Michalski says that they may have formed out of ash
          from volcanic eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up.
          Observations by other Mars missions have hinted that these sediments
          were deposited by wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch.
